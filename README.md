# TReNDS Reading Group

Contains information and resources relevant to TReNDS Reading Group (TRG)

### __*About TRG:*__ 
A brown-bag (bring your own lunch) reading club at Trends Center held mainly for cross pollination of ideas and "out of the comfort zone" fun.  We read and discuss papers, tutorials or packs of papers and ideas at once. The  papers span all areas of machine learning but also venture into brain imaging and theories of how the brain works. The goal is to iteratively learn important concepts and stay current with the literature.

Please sign up for the mailing list or, if youâ€™re a part of the TReNDS center, join the #reading_group channel on slack at trendscenter.slack.com
